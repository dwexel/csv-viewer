In 2021, 8 states have passed anti-transgender laws, while 29 others have attempted similar actions. Some policies, like those that deny transgender youth access to transition-related health services (eg, gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy), have explicit health implications. The health consequences of other policies, like those that ban transgender youth from athletics, are less obvious, though perhaps not absent. Drawing from transgender health research, we caution that anti-transgender legislation could exacerbate existing health disparities, facilitate risky health behaviors, and lead to preventable deaths.

Specifically, structural equation modeling was used to test the unique relations of anti-lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) prejudice; traditional gender role attitudes; need for closure; and social dominance orientation with anti-transgender prejudice. Social desirability was controlled as a covariate in the model. Analyses of data from 250 undergraduate students indicated that anti-LGB prejudice, traditional gender role attitudes, and need for closure each had positive unique relations with anti-transgender prejudice beyond the negative association of social desirability with such prejudice. By contrast, social dominance orientation was not related uniquely to anti-transgender prejudice. Additional analyses indicated that women’s mean level of anti-transgender prejudice was lower than that of men’s, but the pattern of relations between the predictor variables and anti-transgender prejudice did not differ between women and men. A confirmatory factor analysis also supported the unidimensional structure of anti-transgender prejudice as operationalized by Nagoshi et al.’s (2008) Transphobia Scale.","2012-04","2023-09-06 21:23:15","2023-09-06 21:23:15","2023-09-06 21:23:15","251-261","","2","59","","Journal of Counseling Psychology","Anti-transgender prejudice","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\SXWQYZ9K\Tebbe and Moradi - 2012 - Anti-transgender prejudice A structural equation .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled.

With homophobia partialled out, authoritarianism, fundamentalism, and aggression proneness no longer predicted transphobia for men, but authoritarianism, fundamentalism, benevolent sexism, and rape myth acceptance continued to predict transphobia in women.

Past research has found that individual difference variables (e.g., gender, political conservatism) predict transgender prejudice. In the current research, we aimed to better understand the association between transgender prejudice and 15 individual difference predictors (i.e., gender, sexual orientation, single-item political orientation, social dominance orientation, right wing authoritarianism, religiosity, religious fundamentalism, gender essentialism, gender role beliefs, sexism, gender self-esteem, aggression, lesbian, gay, bisexual [LGB] attitudes, contact with LGB individuals, and contact with transgender individuals) by conducting a random-effects meta-analysis. After screening, 82 studies with a total of 36,285 participants met the criteria and were included in the analyses. Across all studies, all predictors except for gender self-esteem (r = .09; 95% CI [-.004, .18]) were significant in predicting transgender prejudice. Overall, there were small to large effect sizes, with LGB attitudes having the largest magnitude (r = .71; 95% CI [.65, .76]) and aggression having the smallest magnitude (r = .15; 95% CI [.08, .23]).

These patterns reveal US women’s poor and declining longevity relative to those in other high-income countries, gaps in knowledge about painful and debilitating conditions that affect millions of women, and deep inequalities that underscore the need to redress political and structural features of US society that enhance health for some and diminish it for others.

It looks at how American culture has shaped the LGBT, or queer, experience, while simultaneously arguing that LGBT people not only shaped but were pivotal in creating our country. Using numerous primary documents and literature, as well as social histories, Bronski's book takes the reader through the centuries--from Columbus' arrival and the brutal treatment the Native peoples received, through the American Revolution's radical challenging of sex and gender roles--to the violent, and liberating, 19th century--and the transformative social justice movements of the 20th. Bronski's book is filled with startling examples of often ignored or unknown aspects of American history: the ineffectiveness of sodomy laws in the colonies, the prevalence of cross-dressing women soldiers in the Civil War, the effect of new technologies on LGBT life in the 19th century, and how rock music and popular culture were, in large part, responsible for the great backlash against gay rights in the late 1970s.

Although there is no denying progress made in military race relations, especially since establishment of the all-volunteer force, this review challenges that comfortable claim as research done over the past two decades supports it only in part. Instead, we conclude that disparities in military allocations of goods and burdens sometimes disadvantage racial minorities. This conclusion rests on a review of institutional analyses in ﬁve arenas to which researchers have paid close attention: racial patterns in enlistment, ofﬁcer promotion rates, administration of military justice, risk of death in combat, and health care for wounded soldiers. Although not a direct or intended result of military policy and practice, in three of ﬁve cases there was evidence of racial bias and institutional racism. Further work is needed to identify mechanisms through which the bias and racism arose.","2012-08-11","2023-09-17 16:12:27","2023-09-17 16:12:28","2023-09-17 16:12:27","401-422","","1","38","","Annu.

In the present analysis, I find that legitimated artists may also be able to act as intermediaries, such as critics and gatekeepers. In doing so, these artists-as-intermediaries, under certain conditions, can shift the meaning of the genre as it transitions. Using the current transition of drag performance from scene-based to industry-based genre as a case, I present a multistage qualitative analysis of televised and digital drag performance. I report three key findings from this analysis: (1) some legitimated artists can become intermediaries when their genre is in transition, (2) these legitimated artists-as-intermediaries can influence genre expectations, and (3) legitimated artists-as-intermediaries’ influence on genre expectations can, in turn, influence the creative expression of other artists. Each of the three findings, however, has the effect of limiting creativity of the artist-as-intermediary and future artists within the industry-based genre.","2019-12","2023-09-19 05:33:49","2023-09-19 05:33:49","2023-09-19 05:33:49","431-452","","4","82","","Soc Psychol Q","Supermodel of the World","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a theoretical model of power in organizations, we propose that sexual harassment is a function of employees’ ﬁnancial dependence on customers (i.e., tips) and deference to customers with emotional labor (“service with a smile”) jointly activating customer power. With a ﬁeld survey study of tipped employees who vary in ﬁnancial dependence and emotional display requirements (Study 1), and an online experiment that manipulates ﬁnancial dependence and emotional displays from the customer’s perspective (Study 2), our results conﬁrm that these contextual factors jointly increase customer power and thus sexual harassment. Our research has important practical implications, suggesting that organizations can reduce customer sexual harassment by changing compensation models or emotional labor expectations in service contexts.","2022-08","2023-09-22 04:37:25","2023-09-22 04:37:25","2023-09-22 04:37:25","1385-1396","","8","107","","Journal of Applied Psychology","A perfect storm","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\ZYKLVRA5\Kundro et al. - 2022 - A perfect storm Customer sexual harassment as a j.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study uses a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design with national school‐level data from 2014 to 2018 to estimate the impacts of SRO placement. We construct this discontinuity based on the application scores for federal school‐based policing grants of linked police agencies. We find that SROs effectively reduce some forms of violence in schools, but do not prevent gun‐related incidents. We also find that SROs intensify the use of suspension, expulsion, police referral, and arrest of students. These increases in disciplinary and police actions are consistently largest for Black students, male students, and students with disabilities.","2021-08","2023-09-25 18:06:24","2023-11-18 21:46:12","2023-09-25 18:06:24","pam.22498","","","","","J Policy Anal Manage","The thin blue line in schools","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","E:\background\policing in schools.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QVGEI58T","journalArticle","","Sankar, Sayujya; Bhaskar, Arpitha","Black Panther: Analysing the Anthropocene through the Aesthetics of Afrofuturism","","","","","","The Anthropocene era marks mankind’s influence on the environment, especially through ecological damage caused by pollution, industrialization and global capitalism. It is crucial to analyse the politics of the Anthropocene by questioning the agency and power dynamic involved in environmental decision-making. Issues of agency are brought out in the film Black Panther (2018) by looking at racial politics, especially with regard to Africa and the African diaspora. One of the ways the movie does this is through the lens of Afrofuturism, which is an aesthetic movement that portrays African themes as well as issues such as racial discrimination through images of technology as well as a celebration of Africa’s folk cultures. By such an intersection of past, present and possible futures, Afrofuturism provides a space for resistance to the Eurocentric domination. This paper aims to look at the various ecocentric Afrofuturistic strategies used in Black Panther to counter the dominant narratives in the Anthropocene, but also discusses some ecological shortcomings in the movie.","","2023-09-25 18:06:33","2023-09-25 18:06:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","E:\background\SayujaSankar-ArpithaBhaskar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These notions extend broadly to individuals living in myriad communities and contexts, highlighting the need to develop insights on creativity within the general population. To provide foundational insights, this study examines the general public’s perspectives on what “creativity” is and the prevalence of conceptualizations of creativity from psychology and sociology literatures in these perspectives. We utilize a nationally representative sample of 3,298 adults living in the United States and code their open-ended responses to the question, “When you hear the word ‘creativity’, what do you think of?” Responses relate creativity to the generation of new thoughts and ideas (31.56%) and to art, artistry, and artistic practices (27.5%) with highest frequency, but only weakly correlate these conceptualizations of creativity. For further examination, this study uses logistic regressions to test for differences across socio-demographic characteristics and the degree to which they explain perceptions of creativity as artistic. Perceptions of creativity as artistic are more likely among White adults, women, and individuals with a college education; the strongest predictor is direct engagement in arts-making activities. This study reorients inquiry about creativity toward understanding the meaning that creativity has within the general population and speaks to the prevalence of persistent links between creativity and the arts.","2022-02","2023-09-28 20:56:15","2023-11-14 15:10:24","2023-09-28 20:56:15","101599","","","90","","Poetics","Innovative and artistic","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\4KBGL2SF\Novak-Leonard et al. - 2022 - Innovative and artistic Conceptions of creativity.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Asian-American Content Creators on TikTok during the Early COVID-19 Pandemic and the #StopAsianHate Movement","","","","","https://osf.io/yfzm9","This paper examines how the concept of “the ethnicized hustle” shapes the content created by Asian American artists/small business owners on Tiktok. (Idriss, 2021) By investigating how Asian American artists/small business owners market their work and participate in hustle culture on Tiktok, we will find the intersection and collapse of the artist and business owner identities in their effort not only to sell art to support themselves and convey their identities, but also to support and uplift their ethnic community. They respond to everyday and platformed racism by creating and selling art, and subsequently donate the proceeds to organizations that support Asian Americans who have been affected by anti-Asian hate. (Southwick et al. 2021) We will also observe the type of TikToks and art produced by Asian American owned sticker shops and methods used to sell their art during the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and the #StopAsianHate Movement. I investigate how their TikTok marketing and content is influenced by the burden of representation and resulting emotional labor and shame, which stems from their need to sell their art to survive, but also their need to be supportive of their communities and be inclusive of others. We will negotiate if the tactics used to boost engagement and bring attention to the #StopAsianHate Movement are an effective mode of political engagement and social justice by investigating audience response in the comment sections under their videos. By doing a content analysis of sounds, hashtags, comment sections, and trends within the small business/art/Asian American communities respectively, this paper will determine whether this work/content creation is performative and/or aspirational, and whether or not it is an effective method to bring about social change.","2022-05-02","2023-10-06 19:34:10","2023-10-06 19:34:11","2023-10-06 19:34:10","","","","","","","Artist or Small Business Owner?","","","","","MediArXiv","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.33767/osf.io/yfzm9","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\98GV7WXV\Capuno - 2022 - Artist or Small Business Owner Asian-American Con.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He styled his name as R. Buckminster Fuller in his writings, publishing more than 30 books and coining or popularizing such terms as ""Spaceship Earth"", ""Dymaxion"" (e.g., Dymaxion house, Dymaxion car, Dymaxion map), ""ephemeralization"", ""synergetics"", and ""tensegrity"". Fuller developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome; carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres. He also served as the second World President of Mensa International from 1974 to 1983.Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal from The Franklin Institute. He was elected an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1967, on the occasion of the 50-year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968. The same year, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. He became a full Academician in 1970, and he received the Gold Medal award from the American Institute of Architects the same year. In 1976, he received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1977, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

This analysis uses an original data set combining 2016 state- and block group-level data from Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, the American Community Survey, and landlord-tenant policy typologies, based on state statutes related to landlord-tenant law. Using multilevel mixed-effects models, we find that neighborhoods in states with more tenant-friendly policy environments were associated with lower eviction and filing rates com­ pared with those in states with more landlord–friendly policies. However, compared with majority-White neighborhoods, eviction and filing rates in communities of color and majority-Black neighborhoods remained signif­ icantly higher—even in states with more tenant-friendly policies. In other words, tenant-friendly policies appear to support the reduction of eviction disparities but not the elimination of them. These findings suggest state housing policy environments matter for eviction-related outcomes broadly and for communities of color. We propose that eliminating racial disparities should include a focus on the implicitly racialized nature of housing and landlord–tenant policy, specifically.","2021-09-03","2023-10-23 06:14:46","2023-10-23 06:14:47","2023-10-23 06:14:46","562-581","","3-5","31","","Housing Policy Debate","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\JFD8Z6DN\Merritt and Farnworth - 2021 - State Landlord–Tenant Policy and Eviction Rates in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Around the world, more and more money is being invested in buildings and land. Real estate is now a $217 trillion dollar industry, worth thirty-six times the value of all the gold ever mined. It forms sixty percent of global assets, and one of the most powerful people in the world-the president of the United States-made his name as a landlord and developer. Samuel Stein shows that this explosive transformation of urban life and politics has been driven not only by the tastes of wealthy newcomers, but by the state-driven process of urban planning. Planning agencies provide a unique window into the ways the state uses and is used by capital, and the means by which urban renovations are translated into rising real estate values and rising rents.

While several studies offer some evidence for the hypothesis, no study has yet tested the most direct spatial implication of this hypothesis within cities: that areas of a city undergoing gentrification or revitalization will evince higher levels of postindustrial policing. In a series of spatial Durbin models that utilize newly available data sets from New York City, this article demonstrates a strong positive association between gentrification and postindustrial policing. The article also finds that citizen demand for postindustrial policing is only weakly associated with its spatial distribution.

To test whether this policy approach holds promise, we assemble digital zoning data covering the Minneapolis?St. Paul metro area and quantify the relationship between different types of residential zoning and racial and ethnic shares of neighborhood populations. Controlling for neighborhood location, we find that a neighborhood zoned for middle housing, such as Minneapolis? triplexes, has a non-White population share that is 14 percentage points higher than that of a single-family zoned neighborhood. A neighborhood zoned for multifamily housing has a non-White population share 21 percentage points higher. This is consistent with the argument that upzoning single-family zones to allow middle and multifamily housing can promote racial integration. Our method can be easily replicated in other regions as data become available.","2023-07-04","2023-10-29 01:33:14","2023-10-29 01:33:14","","821-843","","4","33","","Housing Policy Debate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, I use a spatial discontinuity design to evaluate the impact of minimum lot area restrictions. I ﬁnd that doubling the minimum lot area increases sales prices by 14 percent and rents by 6 percent and intensiﬁes residential segregation. Third, I develop a model of housing demand and supply to estimate households’ preferences for neighborhood zoning stringency and regulatory costs in housing construction. I ﬁnd that white households have strong preferences for strict zoning in their neighborhoods. I use the estimated model to evaluate a counterfactual zoning reform that halves minimum lot areas in Connecticut.

Defining exploitation as being overcharged relative to the market value of a property, the authors find exploitation of tenants to be highest in poor neighborhoods. Landlords in poor neighborhoods also extract higher profits from housing units. Property values and tax burdens are considerably lower in depressed residential areas, but rents are not. Because landlords operating in poor communities face more risks, they hedge their position by raising rents on all tenants, carrying the weight of social structure into price. Since losses are rare, landlords typically realize the surplus risk charge as higher profits. Promoting a relational approach to the analysis of inequality, this study demonstrates how the market strategies of landlords contribute to high rent burdens in low-income neighborhoods.","2019-01-01","2023-10-29 03:09:53","2023-10-29 23:53:12","2023-10-29","","","4","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we show that eviction filing fees, or the amounts of money it costs landlords to begin formal evictions, have a large effect on eviction practices. Specifically, fees that are higher by $76 (one standard deviation) lead to lower eviction filing rates by 1.71 percentage points (0.26 standard deviations) and lower eviction judgment rates by 0.49 percentage points (0.19 standard deviation). Filing fees affect not only the rate but also the purpose of filing, as lower fees make landlords more likely to file serially against the same tenants as a form of rent collection. Each of these effects appears to be disproportionately large in majority-Black tracts, suggesting that low filing fees have disparate impacts on Black renters. These findings contribute to our understanding of the legal basis of housing insecurity and the racialization of eviction practices in the United States.","","2023-10-29 03:12:47","2023-10-29 03:12:47","","1-21","","","","","Housing Policy Debate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years new information has become available on the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and its catalytic intermediates, mechanisms of catalysis and the function of specific amino acid residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution techniques are now used routinely to investigate the structure and function of horseradish peroxidase and offer the opportunity to develop engineered enzymes for practical applications in natural product and fine chemicals synthesis, medical diagnostics and bioremediation. A combination of horseradish peroxidase and indole-3-acetic acid or its derivatives is currently being evaluated as an agent for use in targeted cancer therapies. Physiological roles traditionally associated with the enzyme that include indole-3-acetic acid metabolism, cross-linking of biological polymers and lignification are becoming better understood at the molecular level, but the involvement of specific horseradish peroxidase isoenzymes in these processes is not yet clearly defined. Progress in this area should result from the identification of the entire peroxidase gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana, which has now been completed.","2004-02-01","2023-11-03 08:02:04","2023-11-03 08:02:04","","249-259","","3","65","","Phytochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cruciferae; Heme; Horseradish peroxidase; Hydrogen peroxide; Indole-3-acetic acid; Protein engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrated that guaiacol is a good substrate for both compounds I and II, the two- and one-electron oxidized enzyme intermediates, respectively, of lignin peroxidase. The rate constant for the reaction with compound I is 1.2 × 106M-1 s-1. The reaction of guaiacol with compound II exhibits a Kd of 64 μM and a first-order rate constant of 17 s-1. Oxidation of guaiacol leads to tetraguaiacol formation. This reaction exhibits classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 160 μM and a kcat of 7.7 s-1. Veratryl alcohol, a secondary metabolite of ligninolytic fungi, is capable of mediating the oxidation of guaiacol. This was shown by steady-state inhibition studies. Guaiacol completely inhibited the oxidation of veratryl alcohol, whereas veratryl alcohol had no corresponding inhibitory effect on guaiacol oxidation. In fact, at low guaiacol concentrations, veratryl alcohol stimulated the rate of guaiacol oxidation. These results collectively demonstrate that veratryl alcohol can serve as a mediator for phenolic substrates in the lignin peroxidase reaction.","1995-09-22","2023-11-03 08:09:25","2023-11-03 08:09:25","","22254-22258","","38","270","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, the discipline of art history emphasized painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture, ceramics and decorative arts; yet today, art history examines broader aspects of visual culture, including the various visual and conceptual outcomes related to an ever-evolving definition of art. Art history encompasses the study of objects created by different cultures around the world and throughout history that convey meaning, importance or serve usefulness primarily through visual representations. As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value for individual works with respect to others of comparable style or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or ""philosophy of art"", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were their teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were their disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.","2023-10-02","2023-11-12 22:19:12","2023-11-12 22:19:12","2023-11-12 22:19:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 1178200965","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\E8I75HKD\Art_history.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the organisms remain relatively uncommon overall, their incidence is steadily increasing with associated increases in mortality and pharmacoeconomic impact. As evidenced by the dearth of new products in the pipeline or in clinical use, the conventional paradigm for the development of drugs against such pathogens is generally ineffectual. We advocate the need for a shift in the current paradigm and propose innovative development programs that involve implementation of a graduated approval process. The initial phase of the proposed regulatory paradigm includes early approval of a new drug based on a robust nonrandomized study, buttressed by data from concurrent controls and a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic package generated from nonclinical studies. The postapproval commitment phase will include a randomized controlled trial, when disease prevalence permits, as well as continued assessment of risks and benefits under ""real world"" settings.","2012-08","2023-11-15 19:58:18","2023-11-15 19:58:18","","562-567","","4","55","","Clin Infect Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22610933","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\P9WDPNE5\Alemayehu et al. - 2012 - A paradigm shift in drug development for treatment.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22610933","","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Approval; Drug Discovery; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Guidelines as Topic; Humans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As David Kirp observed of this period: Support for schooling increased dramatically at every level of government The ideas of racial equality and educational reform were closely intertwined. The demand for racial justice formed part of the call for modernization, and the availability of new resources made attentiveness to race specific issues politically more palatable. (1982, 297)             Today, crime in and around schools is playing a similar role as the problem that must be confronted and documented by a reinforcing spiral of political will and the production of new knowledge about school crime. Ironically, the genealogy of crime as a political problem in schools may have had its most salient recent origins in the desegregation era and the often violent conflits that arose around efforts to dismantle racially bifurcated public school systems. Although the stamp of desegregation remains on many public school systems today, by the late 1970s, it had largely run its course, defeated by private action and judicial retreat.

Denaturants are chemical or physical agents that can induce unfolding of the polypeptide chain. Examples include urea, heat, extremes of pH, as well as some detergents.

"3BMK5Y89","journalArticle","","Lareau, Annette; Weininger, Elliot B","Cultural capital in educational research: A critical assessment","","","","","","In this article, we assess how the concept of cultural capital has been imported into the English language, focusing on educational research. We argue that a dominant interpretation of cultural capital has coalesced with two central premises. First, cultural capital denotes knowledge of or facility with ‘‘highbrow’’ aesthetic culture. Secondly, cultural capital is analytically and causally distinct from other important forms of knowledge or competence (termed ‘‘technical skills,’’ ‘‘human capital,’’ etc.). We then review Bourdieu’s educational writings to demonstrate that neither of these premises is essential to his understanding of cultural capital. In the third section, we discuss a set of English-language studies that draw on the concept of cultural capital, but eschew the dominant interpretation. These serve as the point of departure for an alternative de¢nition. Our de¢nition emphasizes Bourdieu’s reference to the capacity of a social class to ‘‘impose’’ advantageous standards of evaluation on the educational institution. We discuss the empirical requirements that adherence to such a de¢nition entails for researchers, and provide a brief illustration of the intersection of institutionalized evaluative standards and the educational practices of families belonging to di¡erent social classes. Using ethnographic data from a study of social class di¡erences in family-school relationships, we show how an African-American middle-class family exhibits cultural capital in a way that an African-American family below the poverty level does not.","","2023-12-05 07:53:34","2023-12-05 07:53:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\7TC386XM\Lareau and Weininger - Cultural capital in educational research A critic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that the Black-White disciplinary gaps, defined in a variety of ways and robust to a series of specification tests, emerge as early as in prekindergarten and widen with grade progression. The magnitude of these disciplinary gaps attenuates by about half when we control for many student- and school-level characteristics, but it persists within districts and schools. In contrast, we find that Hispanic-White gaps are initially null and statistically insignificant at the prekindergarten/kindergarten level and attenuate substantially after adjustment for cross-school (district) variation and other covariates. We further disentangle the discipline gap using a decomposition technique that provides empirical support for the hypothesis that Black students nonrandomly sort into more punitive disciplinary environments.","2019-04-01","2023-12-09 10:27:49","2023-12-09 10:27:49","2023-12-09 10:27:49","2332858419844613","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\J24FQAFC\Gopalan and Nelson - 2019 - Understanding the Racial Discipline Gap in Schools.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These systems encompass networks of economic, political, scientiﬁc, and ideological practices that link global systems of agricultural trade under racial capitalism to the hyper-local contexts of biological exposure and metabolic processing of sugar. Sugar’s pernicious eﬀects are magniﬁed by forces which guide sugar into Black bodies, becoming the source of extraordinary levels of toxicity and chronic metabolic disease for Black people the United States. This burden of metabolic disease, which also aﬀects metabolic function and gene expression, also creates demand for forproﬁt health services that palliate, but do not treat the root causes of, chronic illness resulting from exposure to sugar.

"CU74TEWP","journalArticle","","Shostak, Sara","Food and Inequality","","","","","","The production, consumption, materiality, and meanings of food are critical topics for sociological research on inequality, although they have not always been recognized as such. This article describes how food is implicated in the production of inequalities across scales and sites. It begins by considering how the global food system is inextricably imbricated with structures of power that create and sustain patterns of inequality, especially in regard to land and labor. It then reviews the literature on food access and food insecurity, not only as determinants of health but as lived experiences shaped by local food environments, intersectional identities, and the social meanings of food. Lastly, it considers how the food justice and food sovereignty movements challenge the inequalities and injustices engendered by the global industrial food system. The conclusions highlight how sociological research on food and inequality is essential to understanding the contexts and consequences of contemporary policy initiatives.","","2023-12-12 22:58:35","2023-12-12 22:58:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\E6WX3JAF\Shostak - Food and Inequality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In As We Have Always Done, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson locates Indigenous political resurgence as a practice rooted in uniquely Indigenous theorizing, writing, organizing, and thinking. Indigenous resistance is a radical rejection of contemporary colonialism focused around the refusal of the dispossession of both Indigenous bodies and land. Simpson makes clear that its goal can no longer be cultural resurgence as a mechanism for inclusion in a multicultural mosaic. Instead, she calls for unapologetic, place-based Indigenous alternatives to the destructive logics of the settler colonial state, including heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalist exploitation.","2017","2023-12-17 11:44:22","2023-12-17 11:47:14","","191-210","","","","","","","","","","","University of Minnesota Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants’ sense of being watched was manipulated by testing each of them in two settings, one of which contained an eyespots stimulus. Both social factors significantly affected the participants’ judgments—unexpectedly, however, with conformity pressure only working in the downward direction and eyespots leading to an overall downward shift in participants’ judgments.

We investigated whether elaborative and descriptive titles change the appreciation and understanding of paintings. Under long presentation times (90s) in Experiment 1, testing representative and abstract paintings, elaborative titles increased the understanding of abstract paintings but not their appreciation. In order to test predictions concerning the time course of understanding and aesthetic appreciation [Leder, H., Belke, B., Oeberst, A., & Augustin, D. (2004). A model of aesthetic appreciation and aesthetic judgments. British Journal of Psychology, 95(4), 489–508] in Experiment 2, abstract paintings were presented under two presentation times. For short presentation times (1s), descriptive titles increased the understanding more than elaborative titles, whereas for medium presentation times (10s), elaborative titles increased the understanding more than descriptive titles. Thus, with artworks a presentation time of around 10s might be needed, to assign a meaning beyond the mere description. Only at medium presentation times did the participants with more art knowledge have a better understanding of the paintings than participants with less art knowledge. Thus, it seems that art knowledge becomes significant, if there is sufficient time to assign a meaning and the present studies reveal the importance of considering the time course in aesthetic appreciation.","2006-02-01","2023-12-19 05:19:17","2023-12-19 05:19:17","2023-12-19 05:19:17","176-198","","2","121","","Acta Psychologica","Entitling art","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\S9BAG4N4\S0001691805001009.html","","","Aesthetic preferences; Art perception; Cognitive processes; Contextual associations; Entitling; Meaning; Visual","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Art experience lets us reﬂect on the content, the style, and the artist behind the artwork—moreover, it lets us reﬂect about the percept, perception, the world, ultimately: about us. Current works in the ﬁeld of empirical aesthetics unfortunately often ignore context factors that are so important for such deep and far-reaching experiences. Here I intend to refer to the different paths of measuring art experience via Path #1 by testing within the ecological valid context of art galleries via ﬁeld studies, via Path #2 by simulating certain contextual and perceptual factors in a lab-oriented study design and via Path #3 by testing art-related material in labs without paying attention to such factors. The way we research art experience drastically changes the quality and nature of the output, especially if we ignore certain essential factors which are typically involved when encountering art galleries in real life via Path #3—mainly because participants do not show the typical motivation, interest and effort which they would typically face in art galleries. Furthermore, because the depiction quality of artworks, the context and the social situation in which they are inspected is fundamentally different in the lab, the respective impression is also very different. As most research ignores such factors, we might often be misled by the results of such studies; especially when the extraordinary and unique cultural status that makes artworks so different to ordinary objects is ignored. The paper aims to guide researchers in ﬁnding the right study paradigm and best measures to answer their regarding research questions most adequately. c 2019 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","2019-01-01","2023-12-19 05:19:58","2023-12-19 05:19:59","2023-12-19 05:19:58","010501-1-010501-7","","1","2","","jpi","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\52YSJSBL\Carbon - 2019 - Empirical Approaches to Studying Art Experience.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a question that drives the work of Judith Butler, a gender theorist and distinguished professor at the University of California at Berkeley.  While acknowledging the biological realities of sex, Butler promotes the concept of gender as performative — something that is enacted and shaped through our actions and interactions. This view, although challenging to traditional perspectives, is instrumental in the discourse on queer, trans, and women's rights. Butler encourages a shift in societal conversation to include diverse gender identities.  This transformation, they believe, allows us to work toward a society where equality, freedom, and justice are at the forefront, reinforcing the foundations of our democratic society. 0:00 What is gender theory? 1:34 Sex and gender: What’s the difference? 2:29 Learning from genocide 3:34 Queer theory in the 1970s & ’80s 4:56 Big ideas in gender theory’s evolution 7:06 Gender is “performative”: What that means 9:04 The resistance to trans rights 10:37 Countering the attack on gender Read the video transcript ► https://bigthink.com/series/legends/g... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  About Judith Butler: Judith Butler is a post-structuralist philosopher and queer theorist.

Despite generating clear testable hypotheses, this theory is not based on robust empirical research. We, therefore, use representative data from the EU to test five of its core hypotheses. Although we find that the perception of doing useless work is strongly associated with poor wellbeing, our findings contradict the main propositions of Graeber?s theory. The proportion of employees describing their jobs as useless is low and declining and bears little relationship to Graeber?s predictions.

Thus, several explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. David Graeber?s ?bullshit jobs theory?, for example, claims that some jobs are in fact objectively useless, and that these are found more often in certain occupations than in others. Quantitative research on Europe, however, finds little support for Graeber?s theory and claims that alienation may be better suited to explain why people consider their jobs socially useless. This study extends previous analyses by drawing on a rich, under-utilized dataset and provides new evidence for the United States specifically. Contrary to previous studies, it thus finds robust support for Graeber?s theory on bullshit jobs.

Board of Education decision, researchers and policy makers have paid close attention to trends in school segregation. Here we review the evidence regarding trends and consequences of both racial and economic school segregation since Brown. The evidence suggests that the most signiﬁcant declines in black-white school segregation occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There is disagreement about the direction of more recent trends in racial segregation, largely driven by how one deﬁnes and measures segregation. Depending on the deﬁnition used, segregation has either increased substantially or changed little, although there are important differences in the trends across regions, racial groups, and institutional levels. Limited evidence on school economic segregation makes documenting trends difﬁcult, but students appear to be more segregated by income across schools and districts today than in 1990. We also discuss the role of desegregation litigation, demographic changes, and residential segregation in shaping trends in both racial and economic segregation. We develop a general conceptual model of how and why school segregation might affect students and review the relatively thin body of empirical evidence that explicitly assesses the consequences of school segregation. We conclude with a discussion of aspects of school segregation on which further research is needed.","2014-07-30","2024-02-26 02:23:50","2024-02-26 02:23:51","2024-02-26 02:23:50","199-218","","1","40","","Annu.

To understand this pattern, I employ a survey experiment with New York City families actively choosing schools and investigate whether they express racialized school preferences. I find school racial composition heterogeneously affects white, black, Latinx, and Asian parents’ and students’ willingness to attend schools. Independent of characteristics potentially correlated with race, white and Asian families preferred white schools over black and Latinx schools, Latinx families preferred Latinx schools over black schools, and black families preferred black schools over white schools. Results, importantly, demonstrate that racial composition has larger effects on white and Latinx parents’ preferences compared with white and Latinx students and smaller effects on black parents compared with black students. To ensure results were not an artifact of experimental conditions, I validate findings using administrative data on New York City families’ actual school choices in 2013.

Utilizing the vast social science literature on the history of school desegregation, we specifically examine the level of involvement required from all three branches of the United States federal government to desegregate public schools. We argue that aggressive and repeated involvement was required from the United States federal government, including the Supreme Court, President, federal law enforcement agencies, and Congress, to desegregate public schools, thereby demonstrating the intense commitment needed from institutions to alter racial hierarchies. However, because most formerly desegregated public schools experienced rapid resegregation after declining involvement from the federal government, we also conclude that alterations to racial structures are unlikely to be maintained without continual force from institutions.","2019-03","2024-02-28 07:10:00","2024-02-28 07:10:00","2024-02-28 07:10:00","e12665","","3","13","","Sociology Compass","The power and limits of institutions in altering the racial hierarchy of the United States","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\26ZSM52V\McNeill and Rowley - 2019 - The power and limits of institutions in altering t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The argument is made that this context explains the failure to address inequality in the current agenda for educational reform. The present inattention reflects the politics of economic scarcity and social conservatism, but, more importantly, it reflects persistent and deeply rooted assumptions about human abilities and the role of schools in providing equal opportunity. Neither the mood of generosity toward poor and minority children in the 1960s nor the current stinginess has altered the enduring differentiated structure of school.","1986-01","2024-03-17 02:47:11","2024-03-17 02:47:11","2024-03-17 02:47:11","60-80","","1","168","","Journal of Education","Tracking, Inequality, and the Rhetoric of Reform","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\V6EXVEKJ\Oakes - 1986 - Tracking, Inequality, and the Rhetoric of Reform .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today, all of the city's public schools are charter schools. Although many analyses mark the beginning of education reform in New Orleans with Katrina, in Public Schools, Private Governance, J. Celeste Layargues that the storm merely accelerated the timeline for reforms that had inched along incrementally over the previous decade. Both before and after Katrina, white reformers purposely excluded Black educators, community members, and parents. Public Schools, Private Governance traces the slow, deliberate dismantling of New Orleans'public schools, and the processes that have maintained the reforms made in Katrina's immediate aftermath, showing how Black parents and residents were left without a voice and the officials charged with school governance, most of whom are white, with little accountability. Lay cogently explains how political minorities disrupted systems to create change and keep reforms in place, and the predictable political effects—exclusion, frustration, and resignation—on the part of those most directly affected.","2022","2024-03-25 06:09:58","2024-03-25 06:09:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Temple University Press","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","English","","","eBook Collection (EBSCOhost)","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","Charter schools--Louisiana--New Orleans; EDUCATION / General; EDUCATION / Schools / Types / Charter; Education--Parent participation--Louisiana--New Orleans; Educational change--Louisiana--New Orleans; Hurricane Katrina, 2005--Political aspects; Privatization in education--Louisiana--New Orleans; Public schools--Louisiana--New Orleans; Public schools--State supervision--Louisiana--New Orleans; Race relations in school management--Louisiana--New Orleans; School management and organization--Louisiana--New Orleans; SOCIAL SCIENCE / Cultural & Ethnic Studies / American / African American & Black Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, there is limited research examining the role of policies in promoting inequality by encouraging exclusionary behaviors. In this article, we utilize the concept of opportunity hoarding to analyze the specific policy provisions built into New York City’s elementary and high school choice plans that prompt middle-class parents to act in ways that secure advantages for their children. We find that parents’ anxiety about scarcity of highquality educational options combined with the design of the choice policies facilitated pervasive opportunity hoarding that functioned as a collective strategy of class preservation.","2020-11","2024-04-15 23:39:13","2024-04-15 23:39:13","2024-04-15 23:39:13","992-1035","","7","34","","Educational Policy","Opportunity Hoarding in School Choice Contexts","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\3B8ID8F9\Sattin-Bajaj and Roda - 2020 - Opportunity Hoarding in School Choice Contexts Th.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that 65 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the more the specific mechanism—policies and contexts—of racial segregation in education change, the more solidified the hierarchies of status and prestige that perpetuate segregation remain the same. Racial segregation today, for instance, remains grounded in a belief system of black and Latinx inferiority—a racial hierarchy of valued knowledge and culture, and thus a racialized understanding of “good” schools and students. We organize our research findings on gentrifying neighborhoods and school choices within New York City into three levels to illustrate the current processes of racial segregation: 1) the macro-level neoliberal and free market reform context, 2) the meso-level terms of engagement as schools functions within that market, and 3) the micro-level of individual school choices of parents within this context defined by inequality and standardized test-based accountability. We conclude that the current school choice and market-based school reform education policies will lead to more, and not less racial, ethnic and cultural segregation as the segmented market does its job. The losers are the children and our democracy within a diverse and increasingly divided nation.","2019-10-20","2024-04-15 23:39:33","2024-04-15 23:39:33","2024-04-15 23:39:33","471-492","","5","94","","Peabody Journal of Education","The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\dexte\Zotero\storage\XJBNGRB8\Wells et al. - 2019 - The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Sam.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
